# Churn-Analysis---ConnectTel
The undertaken project involves a comprehensive examination of customer attrition within a Telecommunications company, employing Python for analysis. The project includes both a Python file and a PowerPoint presentation, presenting key insights derived from the data. The dataset underwent rigorous processing through the data science pipeline. Notably, the project encompasses multivariate, bivariate, and univariate exploratory data analyses (EDA) to gain valuable insights from the dataset. Additionally, the project entails the exploration of four distinct predictive machine learning models, involving thorough testing, training, validation, and evaluation processes to identify the most effective model for predicting customer attrition.
